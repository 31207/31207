### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- Im a senior 3 student in China, who like computer programming very much.
- I have learnt C++ and Python for almost 6 years, but.. actually, because of the pressure of senior study, I could only consider them as my after-school hobby.So I don't have a good command of them.
- Also I am an OSU!Mania player. Here is my page.
